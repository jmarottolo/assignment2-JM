# assignment2-JM

used the penguins.csv dataset in RStudio
name of the data analysis script in my local repository is Descriptive_Analyses.R,
and this script loads in the dataset, produces a .csv file of summary statistics by species, and 
produces a plot of bodymass vs bill length by species.

# to reproduce the analysis, you must: 
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Project Folder in RStudio
3 Open the Descriptive_Analyses.R script
4. Install required R packages (dplyr, ggplot2)
5. Run the script (click source, or code --> source("Descriptive_Analyses.R"))
